This is a repository for my ENGR103 final

Game Description:

This is a game where, depending on the prompt from the circuit, you must complete the task, whether by pressing a button or increasing the sound levels. Each level comprises a random 5 sequences and increases in difficulty after each round. There are 5 rounds in total. The increase in difficulty decreases the time you have to complete the task. If you fail a level, the board says, “Game Over,” and you lose. You can end the game by using the switch.

Rules
- Speed increases at each level
- Flipping the switch ends the game (change)
